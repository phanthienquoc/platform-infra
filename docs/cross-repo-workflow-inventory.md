# Cross-Repository Workflow Inventory

Last reviewed: 2026-11-11 06:14 ICT (2026-11-10 23:14:15 UTC).

This is the compact current workflow inventory. The previous append-only inventory is preserved at docs/archive/cross-repo-workflow-inventory-append-only-2026-11-10.md. Historical timestamped workflow checkpoints remain under docs/cross-repo-workflow-inventory-checkpoints/.

## Ownership and production authority

| Repository | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| TCE-dashboard | App CI, tests, build verification, immutable TCE/MicroFE GHCR publication, public app health probes and app-specific backup/integration checks | Production manifests, shared pull credentials, production GitOps apply, K3s rollout or direct SSH/Compose deployment |
| StockDividend | App CI, tests, native ARM64 immutable image publication, scraper and safe credential preflight | Platform manifests, shared GHCR credentials, direct Kubernetes/SSH/Compose production deployment |
| Media Generation | App CI, tests and immutable image publication | Platform manifests, shared pull credentials, direct production deployment |
| phanthienquoc-authentication | Auth CI, tests, release/provenance and immutable app publication | Shared pull credentials, production manifests, direct production apply |
| platform-infra | Production manifests, shared GHCR pull credentials, source-run/provenance verification, digest promotion, GitOps reconciliation, rollout, runtime inspection and health verification | App source tests/builds or app-owned image publication |

Platform reconcile-vps.yml is the single production apply authority. Platform inspect-vps.yml is read-only. Manual reconcile dispatch has no image-change override; only the provenance-verified gitops-promoted-ready repository_dispatch may bypass the image guard after the originating promotion run and required jobs are verified. Do not add competing SSH/Compose deployment authorities in app repositories.

## StockDividend workflow files on master

- `ci.yml` — app CI/tests, including non-publishing native ARM64 builds for scraper/admin/backend.
- `deploy.yml` — app-owned, gated native ARM64 immutable image publisher. Code review confirms the workflow requires a native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner, publishes scraper/admin/backend with full-source-SHA and `prod-v<semver>-<sha>` tags, verifies `linux/arm64` descriptors and digest equality for both tags, and refuses existing immutable tags. Manual publication requires `STOCKDIVIDEND_PRODUCTION_RELEASE_ENABLED=true`. The workflow does not dispatch to Platform; approved digests are handed off separately. No publication was run in this checkpoint.
- `run_scraper.yml` — weekend scraper with fail-closed `VNSTOCK_API_KEY` preflight and side-effect-free `preflight_only=true` path.

## Media Generation workflow files on master

- ci.yml — app CI/tests.
- wf-03-media-production-deploy.yml — app-owned immutable image publication and Platform promotion handoff; production promotion remains token/owner gated.

## Authentication workflow files on master

- ci.yml — service CI/tests.
- release.yml — app-owned release and immutable publication/provenance.
- web-ci.yml — web CI/tests.

## Native schedule contracts

Only first-attempt event=schedule runs on master count for cadence acceptance. Push, pull_request, workflow_run, workflow_dispatch and repository_dispatch are not native schedule substitutes.

| Workflow | Current cron | Existing age/gap budget |
|---|---|---:|
| Platform reconcile-vps.yml | 7,22,37,52 * * * * | 2700s |
| Platform inspect-vps.yml | 2,32 * * * * | 4500s |
| Platform recover-stale-ops.yml | 10,25,40,55 * * * * | 2700s |
| Platform reconcile-schedule-watchdog.yml | 12,27,42,57 * * * * | 2700s |
| TCE wf-06-tce-healthcheck.yml | */15 * * * * | 1500s |
| TCE wf-12-tce-healthcheck-schedule-watchdog.yml | 7,22,37,52 * * * * | 1500s |

Current native evidence and exact age/gap values are in docs/cross-repo-deployment-tracker.md. Do not change cron, freshness budgets or TCE market-scan scheduling to hide delivery gaps.

## Publication and GitOps contract

1. App repository builds/tests and publishes immutable full-source-SHA plus version/source-SHA tags.
2. Publisher verifies architecture descriptors and registry-resolved digest equality before dispatch.
3. Platform verifies source workflow path, source SHA, run ID, attempt, release tag and image digests; it does not trust mutable tags or caller-supplied payloads alone.
4. Only the `gitops-promoted-ready` repository_dispatch may authorize workload image replacement, and only after Platform validates the originating promotion run, required job results, release identity, source commit and digest-pinned image references. Manual `reconcile-vps.yml` dispatch exposes no image-change override.
5. Manual, scheduled and push-triggered reconciliation remain subject to `guard-reconcile-images.sh`; non-image manifest changes can still be applied through the single Platform apply authority.
6. Platform validates digest references, reconciles production manifests and verifies rollout/health only with fresh runtime evidence.
7. Shared `ghcr-pull` credentials are Platform-owned; app workflows must not rotate or mutate them.
8. Repository-level pre-push tag-absence guards and digest checks do not prove GHCR server-side immutable-tag policy. Registry-side enforcement remains unverified.

## Preservation decisions

- Keep all CI, test, security, formatting, release, backup, integration, manual and scheduled workflows listed above.
- No workflow is confirmed redundant or obsolete in this review.
- Do not merge owner-decision drafts or trigger a production publisher merely to make the inventory appear complete.
- Do not add duplicate direct SSH/Compose deployment authorities.
- Do not change the TCE market-scan schedule.

## Latest verification — 2026-11-11 06:14 ICT / 23:14:15 UTC

- Current master refs: Platform `98bc3d8c84fdd667d42ca1b938633dd2951ed9f8`; TCE `c4602be3b0a7b624bdb9cd41519cfc70a14d92ab`; Stock `b1b5e177c9983ecdbbec2f2ead2d54f63b90ca61`; Media `dcd698699c65ba6e73f6b43838975144777131c3`; Authentication `eab85fab32d7c9baef750c1fedbb93deb8c1333f`.
- PR #1601 merged at `72ed11ef`, removing the manual image-change override. PR #1602 merged at `8b11d662`, adding fresh read-only inspection #42920320410. PR #1603 merged at `98bc3d8c`, fixing Keycloak Markdown and resolver-only push scope.
- PR #1603 exact-head checks: #42921447020 workflow/lint PASS, #42921447003 manifest validation PASS, #42921446835 Keycloak CI PASS. Post-merge checks: #42921556638 workflow/lint PASS, #42921556488 manifest validation PASS, #42921556572 Keycloak CI PASS.
- PR #1603 merge triggered validation workflows only. No `reconcile-vps.yml` or `recover-stale-ops.yml` push run was created. This verifies that the metadata path exclusions prevented a repeat of the earlier docs-only production action.
- Historical push run #42920184478 from PR #1601 misclassified `platform/keycloak/README.md` as a Keycloak workload change, applied the Keycloak resource set and executed the Auth/Keycloak scale-to-zero command. It verified no matching pods remained; pre-scale replicas were not captured, so the exact state transition is unknown. PR #1603 now excludes Keycloak Markdown and adds regression fixtures.
- Fresh full read-only inspection #42920320410 at 23:05:16Z is 539s old, within the 4500s budget. Host ARM64 Ubuntu 22.04.5; 19 GiB RAM available; root disk 56% used / 20 GiB free; `restart_required=yes`; K3s node Ready, v1.36.3+k3s1, containerd 2.3.2-k3s2.
- Workloads: Media backend/frontend 1/1 and digest-pinned; MicroFE Shell/WS/NATS 1/1; TCE frontend/service 0/0; Auth/Keycloak 0/0; public OIDC HTTP 503. Stock Admin two pods and desired Backend one pod ImagePullBackOff on historical ARM64-incompatible `12d63b4`; legacy Backend/Frontend 1/1 on `23b2878`.
- Storage preflight: no Stock/Media PVC or VolumeSnapshot references; the k3s-debug PVC remains. Media runner service/listener active; remote unregister, backup/retention and DNS ownership remain unverified.
- GitOps drift clean. Previous reconciliation #42915749236 verified GHCR read access, Auth runtime Secret with values suppressed, unchanged shared `ghcr-pull`, no managed MicroFE/TCE pull failures and TCE desired/live pairing; manifest apply, image replacement and rollout skipped.
- Native schedule evidence at 23:14:15Z: Platform reconcile #42909757881 age 4699s/gap 19941s; inspection #42887151366 12997s/28677s; recovery #42906791198 5827s/20656s; watchdog #42908417737 5212s/20852s; TCE WF-06 #42872071366 18366s/27554s; WF-12 #42915709227 2426s/17617s. All six current-age and inter-arrival budgets exceeded. Cron and TCE market-scan schedule unchanged.
- CI: TCE backend tests #42822853137 PASS, manual public health #42915762180 FAIL (four HTTP 503 responses); Stock CI #42610360402 PASS, scraper #42457182511 FAIL closed due missing `VNSTOCK_API_KEY`; Media CI #42539512417 PASS; Auth CI #42654579277 PASS.
- GHCR server-side immutable-tag enforcement remains unverified. Branch protection/effective inherited rulesets remain administrator-owned and unverified.
- No new image publication, digest promotion, shared production apply, rollout, namespace/PVC/PV deletion, runner retirement, credential rotation, DNS/database/storage mutation or host reboot occurred in this update. The narrow Auth/Keycloak scale-to-zero command from #42920184478 is the documented earlier side effect. No workflow removed.
