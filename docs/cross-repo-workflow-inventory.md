# Cross-Repository Workflow Inventory

Last reviewed: 2026-11-11 00:30 ICT (2026-11-10 17:30:23 UTC)

This is the compact current workflow inventory. The previous append-only inventory is preserved at docs/archive/cross-repo-workflow-inventory-append-only-2026-11-10.md. Historical timestamped workflow checkpoints remain under docs/cross-repo-workflow-inventory-checkpoints/.

## Ownership and production authority

| Repository | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| TCE-dashboard | App CI, tests, build verification, immutable TCE/MicroFE GHCR publication, public app health probes and app-specific backup/integration checks | Production manifests, shared pull credentials, production GitOps apply, K3s rollout or direct SSH/Compose deployment |
| StockDividend | App CI, tests, native ARM64 immutable image publication, scraper and safe credential preflight | Platform manifests, shared GHCR credentials, direct Kubernetes/SSH/Compose production deployment |
| Media Generation | App CI, tests and immutable image publication | Platform manifests, shared pull credentials, direct production deployment |
| phanthienquoc-authentication | Auth CI, tests, release/provenance and immutable app publication | Shared pull credentials, production manifests, direct production apply |
| platform-infra | Production manifests, shared GHCR pull credentials, source-run/provenance verification, digest promotion, GitOps reconciliation, rollout, runtime inspection and health verification | App source tests/builds or app-owned image publication |

Platform reconcile-vps.yml is the single production apply authority. Platform inspect-vps.yml is read-only. Do not add competing SSH/Compose deployment authorities in app repositories.

## StockDividend workflow files on master

- `ci.yml` — app CI/tests, including non-publishing native ARM64 builds for scraper/admin/backend.
- `deploy.yml` — app-owned, gated native ARM64 immutable image publisher. Code review confirms the workflow requires a native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner, publishes scraper/admin/backend with full-source-SHA and `prod-v<semver>-<sha>` tags, verifies `linux/arm64` descriptors and digest equality for both tags, and refuses existing immutable tags. Manual publication requires `STOCKDIVIDEND_PRODUCTION_RELEASE_ENABLED=true`. The workflow does not dispatch to Platform; approved digests are handed off separately. No publication was run in this checkpoint.
- `run_scraper.yml` — weekend scraper with fail-closed `VNSTOCK_API_KEY` preflight and side-effect-free `preflight_only=true` path.

## Media Generation workflow files on master

- ci.yml — app CI/tests.
- wf-03-media-production-deploy.yml — app-owned immutable image publication and Platform promotion handoff; production promotion remains token/owner gated.

## Authentication workflow files on master

- ci.yml — service CI/tests.
- release.yml — app-owned release and immutable publication/provenance.
- web-ci.yml — web CI/tests.

## Native schedule contracts

Only first-attempt event=schedule runs on master count for cadence acceptance. Push, pull_request, workflow_run, workflow_dispatch and repository_dispatch are not native schedule substitutes.

| Workflow | Current cron | Existing age/gap budget |
|---|---|---:|
| Platform reconcile-vps.yml | 7,22,37,52 * * * * | 2700s |
| Platform inspect-vps.yml | 2,32 * * * * | 4500s |
| Platform recover-stale-ops.yml | 10,25,40,55 * * * * | 2700s |
| Platform reconcile-schedule-watchdog.yml | 12,27,42,57 * * * * | 2700s |
| TCE wf-06-tce-healthcheck.yml | */15 * * * * | 1500s |
| TCE wf-12-tce-healthcheck-schedule-watchdog.yml | 7,22,37,52 * * * * | 1500s |

Current native evidence and exact age/gap values are in docs/cross-repo-deployment-tracker.md. Do not change cron, freshness budgets or TCE market-scan scheduling to hide delivery gaps.

## Publication and GitOps contract

1. App repository builds/tests and publishes immutable full-source-SHA plus version/source-SHA tags.
2. Publisher verifies architecture descriptors and registry-resolved digest equality before dispatch.
3. Platform verifies source workflow path, source SHA, run ID, attempt, release tag and image digests; it does not trust mutable tags or caller-supplied payloads alone.
4. Platform validates digest references, reconciles production manifests and verifies rollout/health only with fresh runtime evidence.
5. Shared ghcr-pull credentials are Platform-owned; app workflows must not rotate or mutate them.
6. Repository-level pre-push tag-absence guards and digest checks do not prove GHCR server-side immutable-tag policy. Registry-side enforcement remains unverified.

## Preservation decisions

- Keep all CI, test, security, formatting, release, backup, integration, manual and scheduled workflows listed above.
- No workflow is confirmed redundant or obsolete in this review.
- Do not merge owner-decision drafts or trigger a production publisher merely to make the inventory appear complete.
- Do not add duplicate direct SSH/Compose deployment authorities.
- Do not change the TCE market-scan schedule.

## Latest verification — 2026-11-11 00:30 ICT / 17:30:23 UTC

- Platform master is `0ee1fd060616571ef3790286bb7ea7d7723ed31d`, produced by inspection-only PR #1591. Read-only inspection #42863102352 succeeded and updated only `debug/vps-latest.md`; snapshot generated at 17:15:51Z. PR #1590's prior checkpoint branch was closed without merge because it was behind current master; its 00:11/00:18 checkpoint files are preserved in the replacement branch.
- Latest native Platform reconcile is #42854065227 (16:23:35Z, success); inspection #42809278936 (11:39:41Z, success); recovery #42848981485 (15:52:52Z, success); watchdog #42850178931 (15:59:51Z, failure). TCE native WF-06 #42799497774 and WF-12 #42795292155 remain failed/stale. At the 17:30:23Z reference, all six current ages and inter-arrival gaps exceed their unchanged budgets; manual/dispatch and workflow_run events do not count.
- Latest manual reconciliation #42862361821 completed at 17:11:32Z. GHCR read preflight passed for Auth, MicroFE Shell/WS and TCE web/service packages; Auth runtime Secret was provisioned/verified with values suppressed; shared `ghcr-pull` was unchanged. The image-pull helper found no failures for MicroFE Auth/Shell/WS or TCE service/frontend. GitOps drift=false, so production manifest apply, image replacement and rollout were skipped. This manual run does not refresh native schedule cadence.
- Fresh K3s snapshot: ARM64 node Ready; disk 56% (~20 GiB free), available RAM ~19 GiB, host restart_required=yes. Media backend/frontend and MicroFE Shell/WS/NATS 1/1; TCE/Auth/Keycloak 0/0 maintenance. Stock Admin 0/1 (two ImagePullBackOff pods), desired Backend 0/1 ErrImagePull on historical `12d63b4`; existing Backend/Frontend remain 1/1. Both public OIDC discovery probes HTTP 503; Keycloak diagnostic timed out. Media runner service/listener active; GitHub registration is not inferred.
- Stock publisher code review confirms native ARM64 builds for all three components, full-source-SHA and version+SHA tags, linux/arm64 manifest verification, per-component digest equality and pre-push tag-absence checks. The manual release gate remains disabled until owner approval; no publication/digest handoff occurred. GHCR server-side immutable-tag policy remains unverified.
- Branch API reports `protected=false` on all five master branches; inherited organization ruleset coverage remains unknown because rulesets reads return HTTP 403. Administrator action remains open in issue #1575.
- No workflow was removed; no production apply, rollout, scale, credential rotation, DNS/database/storage mutation, runner retirement or host reboot occurred. TCE market-scan schedule unchanged.
